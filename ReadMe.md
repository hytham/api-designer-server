# API-Designer-JS (this program is out of date and not supported)

This is a simple express server to serve Mulesoft API-designer for more information please visit there website. I build this tool to help me build mule soft YQML files for my internal developments.

To run this application please type in this command 
``` npm run start ```

then navigate to http://localhost:3000

Note: There is some issues in the code when try to use the mockup feature (this is orginally in the library)
